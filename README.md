# diseasion

NOTE:
diseasion is intended and intended only as a personal project of mine from which I learn
Users of this program must abide by absolute regulations found at: http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/money.asp
You are responsible for your own misuse of the program


You can find the entirety of the database here: http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/index.asp
The data used in the existing code uses: http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/disease_index_h.asp


Next Steps for diseasion:
- add a non-spelling-sensitive component to the user's input of symptoms
- add a snippet of code that fetches a certain letter's database link
    - problems with this: the program cannot predict with certainty which letter's database the symptoms will lead to
    - unless: the program parses and stores (during the runtime of the program) the whole database, all 26 letter's database content
